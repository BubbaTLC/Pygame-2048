# Pygame-2048
My recreation of the game 2048 written in Python. This is my first stand alone game written in Python without following a tutorial. The first release is a basic running game. I plan to add the following features in the near future:
- Endless Mode (Ability to go past the 2048 tile)
- AI (Ability to enable a Minimax + Alpha Beta Pruning)
- Window Resizing / Fullscreen

### Branch Main
Contains working code and a working .exe in the output folder.

### Secondary Branch
Contains refactored and additional code.
