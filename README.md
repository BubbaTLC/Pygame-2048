# Pygame-2048
My recreation of the game 2048 written in Python. This is my first stand alone game written in Python without following a tutorial. I plan to add the following features in the near future:
- AI (Ability to enable a Minimax + Alpha Beta Pruning)

### Branch Main
Contains working code and a working .exe in the 2048.zip

### Secondary Branch
Contains refactored and additional code.
